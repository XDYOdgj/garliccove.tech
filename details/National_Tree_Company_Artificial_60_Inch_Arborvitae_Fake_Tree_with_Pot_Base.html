We live in a front range city in Colorado and the real plants received sunlight for most of the afternoon hours in our driveway. Apparently, perhaps a little too much sunlight did them in despite watering. As others have written, some of the twigs will come loose while unpacking and it is sometimes difficult to determine where to put them back on. We love the fact that these artificial shrubs are very realistic looking and require no water and hopefully little or no maintenance. We have a second pair of live trees on our porch and it appears that one of them may also soon die. My wife and I have already talked about purchasing another pair of these Arborvitae Trees to replace those. Incidentally, the 60" description is measured from the bottom of the pot to the tip of the bush.",

I actually went all out and bought 6 of these things and placed them in my front yard. I put them in clay pots and burried them in potting soil so as to make them look more like real trees. After putting them up, the first thing I noticed was how good they looked. The second thing I noticed was several neighbors commenting about how good my trees looked. The third thing I noticed was that when guests would come over and spend time on in the front yard, they would be completely clueless as to the fact the trees were not real until I mentioned it to them. In fact, not one single person to which had commented on the good looks of the lawn renovation noticed that they were artificial trees. The final straw in the bush was that they seem to be lasting very well. I live in the desert where the it gets incredibly hot - like 105 degrees - and tends to fade out all painted items that sit in the sun. These have lasted about 8 months so far. If you are reading this review, please don't take it lightly, these are good artificial trees. I have placed them in the full sun. Meaning they get sun all day long and full on. I suspect they will eventually fade, but I'm really impressed so far. I expect to get at least one more year out of these things. After which time, I'll just get a can of green spray paint and spruce them up sorta-speak. Anyhow, don't let the price of these things be a deciding factor (I think the price was decent enough anyways). I fully recommend these things. Good buy.","purchase_model":"Size: 4ft   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2017-12-11 20:03:30"},{"user":"dcotton","content":"We live in a location that accumulates a lot of snow and gets very cold in the winter. I was afraid to spend money on an expensive pine tree that would just need to be replaced every season.I saw this version on the Young House Love blog, and it is perfect for our front door. I placed it inside of a pot, and it has a heavy base. I filled it with lava rocks to secure and it\u2019s gorgeous. The leaves are bendable so you can adjust them once taken out of the box.It looks real. People constantly are surprised that it\u2019s fake when they see it.

You really can't beat the price either.They came in perfect condition. I just had to \"fluff\" them a bit.I put them in pots with white rock and they look so real from a distance.

I paired them with small string lights, GDEALER 4 Pack Fairy String Lights 50 LED 16.4ft.I needed two strings per tree.I've attached a photo of the trees with and without the lights. I would purchase these trees again.

They really passed the \"acid test\" when my mother-in-law stopped by and asked: \"Are those real?\" We could have said \"Yes!\" and I think she would have believed us.We finally opted to go with faux tree after years of frustration is keeping live trees in pots in front of our home. We live in an area of rural northern Minnesota where it's easy to find and dig up small Norway pines for pot planting -- but they always eventually die. My wife grew tired of the process and now we think we have a permanent solution that will last for years to come.This is a product I can recommend without reservation, with the slight exception of the price being a tad steep (just in my opinion.)The product is made of high-quality material, looks real and classy and solves a basic problem.

We live in a front range city in Colorado and the real plants received sunlight for most of the afternoon hours in our driveway. Apparently, perhaps a little too much sunlight did them in despite watering. As others have written, some of the twigs will come loose while unpacking and it is sometimes difficult to determine where to put them back on. We love the fact that these artificial shrubs are very realistic looking and require no water and hopefully little or no maintenance. We have a second pair of live trees on our porch and it appears that one of them may also soon die. My wife and I have already talked about purchasing another pair of these Arborvitae Trees to replace those. Incidentally, the 60\" description is measured from the bottom of the pot to the tip of the bush.","purchase_model":"Size: 5ft   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2019-07-27 20:03:30"}];
